Here's a task that you can work on to learn about the composite design pattern in Java:

Task: Create a file system using the composite pattern

Create an interface FileSystem with the following methods:

String getName()
long getSize()
Create a concrete class File that implements the FileSystem interface. File should have the following properties:

String name
long size
Create another concrete class Directory that implements the FileSystem interface. Directory should have the following properties:

String name
List<FileSystem> files
Implement the getName() and getSize() methods in both File and Directory. The getName() method should return the name of the file/directory, and the getSize() method should return the size of the file or the sum of the sizes of all the files in the directory.

Test the implementation by creating a directory structure and printing the names and sizes of the files and directories.
